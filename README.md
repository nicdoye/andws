# andws

Another Dumb Web Server

## Really Dumb

This isn't the sort of thing I would ever expect anyone to use, but it demonstrates what can be done in some simple Perl.

## What is it?

It's another simple "run in place" web server. 

## Usage

```bash
> cd "${directory_i_want_to_serve}"
> andws
```

Browse the files in that folder at<br/>
http://localhost:1444


Press `^C` and then download a better server.
